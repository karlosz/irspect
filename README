Installation
============

Load through asdf.  Requires McCLIM and Clouseau.


Usage
=====

Start with (irspect:irspect).

1. Enter something into the text editor, for example:

  (defun schleife (n)
    (loop for i from 0 below n
          collect i))

  Use File -> Quicksave to save the buffer into ~/.irspect.lisp.  This
  file be read on startup automatically.


2. Compile the code using File -> Compile.

   When sb-heapdump support is enabled, this command will create a file
   ~/.irspect.heap that can be loaded later.

   Without sb-heapdump, the intermediate representation is just stored
   in a global variable.


3. (Optional.) Use File -> Load Heap to display the contents of
   ~/.irspect.heap (or the components of the previous compilation if
   irspect was compiled without sb-heapdump support).

4. You should now see a list of components that are available for
   inspecting.

     - Select a component to display its blocks.
     - Select a block to display its nodes.
